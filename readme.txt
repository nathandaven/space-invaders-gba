HW4 by Nathan Davenport

Welcome to my game! It is a recreation of the original Space Invaders, with original art created by me!

Objectives:
    Destroy all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen!
    Avoid the aliens shooting at you!
    The defense blocks can only take four hits before destroying. Be careful!
    However, player shots will not destroy the defense blocks.
    The difficulty increases after a certain point! Be careful!

Controls: 
    left/right to move
    a button to shoot
    start to pause and unpause game
    start to start and restart game from start and win/lose screens
    select from the pause screen to reset the game

Enjoy my space invaders recreation!
